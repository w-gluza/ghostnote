# 🥁 GhostNote MVP – Fullstack Project Checklist

A fullstack groove recognition quiz app — a fun project to level up my backend skills (and improve my listening skills 👂).

This checklist reflects the ideation process behind an app I'm building to support my drum learning journey - something fun and interactive to play with while commuting (or procrastinating 😅). The direction might evolve a bit as I experiment!

## 🎵 How does it work?

Drum patterns are represented as arrays of MIDI steps, with each step encoding both the note and its velocity, allowing for nuanced playback.
GhostNote uses predefined wave samples for drum sounds such as snare and kick, triggered via a custom React hook that maps MIDI data to the appropriate sample and velocity.

**MIDI Steps**

```json
[
  [
    [36, 100],
    [42, 100]
  ],
  [[42, 100]],
  [
    [38, 100],
    [42, 100]
  ],
  [[42, 100]],
  [
    [36, 100],
    [42, 100]
  ],
  [[42, 100]],
  [
    [38, 100],
    [42, 100]
  ],
  [[42, 100]]
]
```

**Readable Grid**

```
Count:         1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
Hi-Hat(42):    x x x x x x x x
Snare(38):         ●       ●
Kick Dum(36):  ●       ●
```
